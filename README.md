# Hi there!
I'm Isaac Chang, a first-year at UChicago. I'm interested in physics, chemistry, data science, and economics -- and I love to solve cool problems.

## Background
- I bashed a lot of olympiads in high school. I was on the 2024 US Physics Team and earned High Honors at the USNCO in 2022 and 2024. Also an USAMO qual.

## Stuff I'm Interested In
- Currently in CMSC 14300 (Systems Programming I) 
- Looking forward to collaborating on any interesting simulation ideas for physics
